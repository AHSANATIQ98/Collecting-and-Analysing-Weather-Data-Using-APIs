# Collecting and Analyzing Weather Data Using APIs

## Overview

In this project, I have collected weather data through APIs. The API data is sourced from a weather website. The list of cities used for data collection is provided in CSV format. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Data Collection

- **Data Source**: The weather data was obtained using an API from [API Provider's Website].
- **Cities List**: The cities for which the data was collected are listed in the `cities.csv` file.

## Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed includes:

- **Top Hottest Cities**: Identified the top hottest cities based on temperature data in Kelvin.
- **Comparison Between Hottest Cities and Humidity**: Analyzed the relationship between temperature and humidity in the hottest cities.
- **Weather Distribution**: Analyzed the distribution of weather data across different cities.

## Files

- `cities.csv`: Contains the list of cities for data collection.
- `weather_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Use
